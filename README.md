# Fluid-Simulation
Programmation project for the third year of double licence Mathematics/Computer sciences at the University of Montpellier.

### Here a sample of the simulation (Thermal convection) :
The Simulation can be reset by pressing 'R'.\

### Here some of the steps displayed during simulation :
Setting pixels to a random temperature.\
![Random](./Results/random.png) \
The pixels are exchanging heat. (With a calculation of the average heat of neighboring pixels).\
![change](./Results/change.png) \
In the end, we get a homogeneous temperature.\
